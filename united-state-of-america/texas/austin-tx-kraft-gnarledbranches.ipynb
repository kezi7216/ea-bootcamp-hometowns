    "A moonlight tower is essentially a VERY tall, antiquated street lamp. For many this was the first/only example of elecitricity they knew of, and were quite a feat to build and a wonder to observe. They are meant to illuminate a wide radius and can be seen from very long distances. They are roughly 160 feet tall, and were constructed in the mid-1890s-- or rather, Austin purchased 31 used towers from the city of Detroit. Today, only a handful of Austin's towers remain intact.\n",
