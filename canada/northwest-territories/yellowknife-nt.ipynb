    "#### Yellowknife is an amazing place. It is the biggest place in all of Canada's Arctic yet it is only just under 20,000 people. It has a very diverse population with tempuratures ranging in summer from 75 degrees to -40 degrees degrees (and that is before windchill). Cold but a truly unique and amazing place, especially when the Northern Lights are out. \n",
